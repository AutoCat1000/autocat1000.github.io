title: AFTERLIFE
---

The AfterLife program is a way to bring people a new life, to let their past life pass on. This is earned from community service - a fun way to earn back your citizenship from under the Kinds of Space.

You will be sent out to explore and gain knowledge in order to earn credits to pay off debts from your past life.

You may also earn back memories if you wish. Many members choose to leave their memories behind as they can be horrific and full of guilt.

The AfterLife program is the Kinds of Space's gift back to the lives of everyone, as everyone deserves a second chance.

The people you see around you are your new crew members. They were specifically chosen for the potential of your group. 6,000 credits have been provided for your equipment, as well as a new ship, which you may name.

Get familiar with your crew members and discuss what you may buy. An ambassador will escort you to your ship shortly, and purchased equipment will be given to you.

And remember, your AfterLife is your new life!
