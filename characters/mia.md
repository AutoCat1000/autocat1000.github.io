# Mia
Android Technomancer *(& Pilot)*

>Y'know, an old gambler I knew had a saying - if you think the other guy might have a blaster hidden under the table... ***bring two blasters.***

Looking at her, you would never guess she wasnâ€™t human. With well defined features and striking red hair, she certainly would be an impressive specimen. However, she is actually a bioengineered Android. This fact is only given away by the few lines of circuitry across her back, connecting her integrated computer and extremities. Tall, slender, and beautiful, it is unknown what her original purpose was. Do not let her looks fool you, however, as she is not just a pretty face. Not much is known of the enigmatic [Name redacted], but her stunning eyes have intelligence and cunning behind them. She is a skilled technomancer. She has spent years learning the intricate rules that  govern our reality and how to manipulate them for her gain. An ace pilot with a dislike (and disregard) for authority, she travels the Galaxy in search of new knowledge to learn, challenges to best, and trouble to get into.
