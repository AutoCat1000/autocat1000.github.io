# Nu
Kasathan Solarian

>Inhale the good shit. **Exhale the bullshit.**

Nu likes to keep a level head. Beware when he loses his temper for he has a sword made of a white dwarf star and a longsword as a back up weapon. He is willing to protect those he cares about the most with his life. He loves meditating and maintaining peace and order around him. Nu is learning the differences between alien races and wants to learn all he can about them. Nu will also never take his scarf off and if you see him without his scarf, he trusts you and thinks of you like family to him.
