> It's more fun to stab things when they're alive.

White hair, purple skin, silver eyes. Tall, even for an elf. Generally intimidating appearance. Has two swords on a belt and a hammer strapped to her back. May appear very nice and sweet despite her looks. **DO NOT TRUST.** Especially when she acts nice. Disdainful and dismissive of all men, especially the short ones and Nu. She will sooner attempt to stab you than look in your general direction. She can be incredibly charming when she wants to (though it usually means that she wants something from you).
