# Ale
Kitsune Operative

>We've all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. **That's who we really are.**

Ale is fiercely loyal to those she trusts, but she realizes when that trust has led her astray. She sometimes tries to find the funny side to things, instead of dealing with the touchy subjects, and that sometimes irritates the people around her.
